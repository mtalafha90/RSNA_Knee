"""The check that turns a mid-epoch crash into a message you can act on.

`RuntimeError: B42 study has no readable MRI series` names no study, no path and
no cause, and arrives after the config, the base checkpoint, the label export
and the whole series index have loaded. On a Windows drive mounted under WSL
that is twenty minutes of waiting for four words.

Two causes produce that identical crash and need opposite fixes -- part of the
images missing, or every image present under a directory name the loader does
not look in. These tests pin that the diagnostic tells them apart.
